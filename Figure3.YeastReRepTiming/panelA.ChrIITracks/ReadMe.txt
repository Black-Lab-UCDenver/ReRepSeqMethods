Please note that Gviz can be difficult to install, and requires R version 3.6. Make sure you have Rcurl working and updated on your machine prior to instillation of Gviz. If you do choose to run the R program in this directory, please change the working directory in the code to the location of the input files.

The input files for this program require the merged yeast replication timing bedgraphs, the ERD/LRD/ARS/TAD annotation files and a text file of the sacCer3 chromosome sizes. All of these files are provided in ths directory.

The output from the code will produce a standard sized genomic track for every chromosome fouund  in the bedgraphs. 

The estimated time to run this script is ~20 mintues.
