This code will generate the figure seen in figure 3 panel c. The figure is generated by creating an average profile for all early or late replicating domains for each time point in the yeast replication timing experiment, allowing us to visualize the average increase and spread of signal over time. The input files for this analysis are provided in this directory. The input files were generated from the normalized-rebinned-smoothed bedgraphs. Each bedgraph for each timepoint was joined with a bed file containing a list of erd and lrds regions. The average across all erds or lrds was then calculated and compiled into the files provided as input.

The output for this script is the generation of a line plot, that needs to be displayed by typing either "pLRD" or "pERD" into the R terminal.
