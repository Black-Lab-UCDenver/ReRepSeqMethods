This code will generate the PCA plot seen in supplemental figure 3, panel B. The input data to run this code was generated using bedtools unionbedg to join the replicates for the cdk bypass experiment based on the bins over the genome. The R script simply formats this data until a pca can be performed, which is then displayed graphically. To visualize the graph, please enter “plot1” into the R terminal after running this code.
