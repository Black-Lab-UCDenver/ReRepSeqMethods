The replication timing domains used the human files were previously defined using a machine learning algorithm and published here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=gse53984

The raw file we used for our analysis is GSE53984_GSM923442_Mcf7_Rep1_segments.bed
Using this file, we lifted the regions from Hg19 to Hg38 via the table browser tool provided by the UCSC genome browser. The resulting domains are found in this file: hg19LiftedToHg38RepTimingDomains.bed
