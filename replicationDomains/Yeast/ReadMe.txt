The replication timing domains used in the analysis of the yeast data are provided in this directory. In yeast, the origins of replication are known (ARS), and well defined. The exact regions we used are in the arsConfimred.bed file. However, classifying these ARSs as either early or late replicating domains is not as well known. To do this, we used historical yeast DNA-array data from an early timepoint in a replication timing experiment that was normalized on a 0-2 scale, and then defined the lower quartile of data as late replicating timepoints, and the upper quartile of data as early. We then merged any regions that were within 10kb of eachother to define early replicating domains and late replicating domains. The resulting regions are in the yeastErdLrd.named file. To associate these early and late regions with their respective ARS sequences, we used bedtools intersect to overlay them. The resulting file is the arsErdLrd.bed file. Finally, we have provided the bed file containing the topological domains used in various yeast analyses here as well.
